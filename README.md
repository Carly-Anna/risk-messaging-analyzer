# Severe Weather Risk Messaging Analyzer üå™Ô∏è

A Python-based tool for analyzing and visualizing the clarity, urgency, and effectiveness of severe weather warning messages across multiple sources ‚Äî including the National Weather Service (NWS), broadcast media, and mobile apps.

This project is designed to help researchers, emergency managers, and communicators understand how different messaging styles impact public perception and response during dangerous weather events.

## Sample Datasets
Included in /data:

- sample_warnings.csv: Collection of warning messages from:
- NWS (official text)
- Broadcast media (TV transcripts or quotes)
- Mobile apps (push alerts)
- Each row includes:
- Source (e.g., "NWS", "Broadcast", "App")
- Text (full warning message)

## Communication Spectrum Score
Each warning is scored on a composite scale combining:

- Readability: How easy is it to understand?

- Urgency: Does it trigger action?

- Sentiment: Does it feel neutral, alarming, or confusing?

### **The goal is not to shame sources but to visualize variation and suggest improvements in crisis communication.**
