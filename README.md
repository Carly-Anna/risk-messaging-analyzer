# Severe Weather Risk Messaging Analyzer üå™Ô∏è

A Python-based tool for analyzing and visualizing the clarity, urgency, and effectiveness of severe weather warning messages across multiple sources ‚Äî including the National Weather Service (NWS), broadcast media, and mobile apps.

## Project Rationale

This project was inspired by my personal experience navigating severe weather warnings through various platforms. As someone actively involved in the weather enterprise, I noticed that iPhone alert messages ‚Äî while timely ‚Äî were often inconsistent, vague, or even confusing. If they confuse me, a weather communicator, I worry how they impact the general public‚Äôs decision-making during life-threatening events.

At the same time, I want to highlight and uplift the important work of the National Weather Service (NWS) and broadcast meteorologists. While the NWS generally follows a consistent, research-backed warning structure, many broadcast meteorologists adapt messaging based on their understanding of local community behavior and needs. That kind of flexibility ‚Äî when rooted in experience and empathy ‚Äî can be powerful, even when it deviates from the standard.

This tool does not aim to rank warnings as good or bad by source, but to show a **spectrum** of language and clarity. The goal is to support better, more consistent risk communication across all platforms by showcasing how messaging style impacts comprehension and emotional response.

By analyzing tone, structure, and readability, this tool provides insight into how we can refine severe weather messaging to save lives and reduce confusion.


This project is designed to help researchers, emergency managers, and communicators understand how different messaging styles impact public perception and response during dangerous weather events.

## Sample Datasets
Included in /data:

- Sample_warnings.csv: Collection of warning messages from:
- NWS (official text)
- Broadcast media (TV transcripts or quotes)
- Mobile apps (push alerts)
- Each row includes:
- Source (e.g., "NWS", "Broadcast", "App")
- Text (full warning message)

## Communication Spectrum Score
Each warning is scored on a composite scale combining:

- Readability: How easy is it to understand?

- Urgency: Does it trigger action?

- Sentiment: Does it feel neutral, alarming, or confusing?

### **The goal is not to shame sources but to visualize variation and suggest improvements in crisis communication.**
